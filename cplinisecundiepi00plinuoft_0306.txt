260 APPENDIX. 1

Mommsen then proceeds to assign aprobable date for the publica-
tion of each book :

Book I ............. 97 Book V. ............ 106

Book II. . . . . 100 (beginning) Book VI ......... 106 or 107
Book III. . . 101, or perhaps 102 Book VII. ........... 107
Book IV ..... 1οι5 (beginning) Book VIII. .......... 109

Book IX„ perhaps at same time as Book VIII.

The Bithynian correspomlence with Trajan, from 111, September,
to 113, after Jallua1¹y.

Boon Ι.

Ep. 5 was written before the return 01 J unius Mauricus from exile,
Which occurred after Jan. 1, 07, but probably not long after Nerve's
accession, and certainly in his reign.

Ep. 12. The death 01 Corellius Rufus seems to have taken place
not long after that 01 Domitian, but he was still alive when Pliny ap-
peared 111 the Senate against the accusers 01 Helvidius (Ep. IX. 13. 6).

Ep. 10. At the date 01 this letter Pliny was in an office which may
have been the praefectura 01 the (cerarium militare (94-96 or 95-97)
or 01 the <tersorium Satzwni (98 on).

Book II., Mommsen thinks, contains letters 01 the years 97-100.

Ep. 1, about the death 01 Verginius, belongs to the end 01 97 01·
the beginning 01 98.

Ep. 13 contains a reference to Nerva’s death. The Priscus there
addressed was probably the legate 01 Pannonia, perhaps in 98 or 99.

Epp. 11 and 12 are 01 certain date, for the decision about Marius
Priscus was in January, 100.

Ep. 7. The emperor who honored Spurinna was probably not
Trajan, but Nerva.

Book III.

Epp. 1ῐῖ and 18, in which Pliny sends a copy 01 his oration 01 thanks
(Septembsw, 100), are unquestionably of 101.

Epp. 4 and 0, about the trial of Classicus, Mommsen thinks must
have been written in the autumn of 101. This is a mooted point. It
is discussed by him at length, but his conclusions are combated by
other writers.

Ep. 8. Ile cites the military diploma (IIcnzen, 5442), in which
L. Neratius Marcellus appears as legszccus Britanniae on 19 Jan., 103,
