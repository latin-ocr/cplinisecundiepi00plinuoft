CHRONOLOGY 263

Another important contribution to the subject is that of C. Peter
(Zur Chronoloyie der Briefe ‹lesjunyaren Plinius, Philologus, XXXII.
698 sqq.). '

Peter criticises Mommsen's view that it is always true that letters
whose dates can be fixed fit into the chronological order and that the
others are not inconsistent with it, and especially the opinion that 110
letters were written before the death of Domitian. He thinks but
little weight is to be attached to the fact that wherever two letters
have a connection the later one always stands later in the collection,
that letters about the same subject or ofv the same period come in the
same book or in two' consecutive books. In the same light he regards
the argument of Mommsen about the age of the correspondents, ob-
serving that most correspondents get but a single letter.

Then follow the positive inferences which Peter draws. In the letters
of the 4th and :3th books I’liny appears as a poet, and a lyric poet at
that. But in Ep. VII. 4 he says that he has nunc primum made an
essay in hemlecasyllabics, while in Ep. VIII. 21 he calls the collection
of his poenis musteus liber, and in Ep. IX. 34 himself a novus poeta.
Hence these letters must have been written earlier than those in books
4 and ἔ).

Ηο finds that Epp. IV. 3, IV. 18, and V. 15, to Arrius Antonius
are notin the right ordei-3 also that the same is true of Epp. VIII. 1
and IX. 34, and of Epp. II. 11, ΙΙ. 1:33 compared with Epp. III. 4,
III. 9.

With reference to Ep. II. 0, 110 argues that it disproves the idea
that the letters of the 211 book go only to the beginning of 100, 011
account of chronological considerations, which, he states, render it
impossible that Erucius should have been a candidate for the tribune-
ship in 100.

The most careful attention is devoted to the date of the trial of
Classicus, which Mommsen places in 101, forgetting, as Peter claims,
the fact that the case of Marius (Ep. II. 11) was twice under discus-
sion, — once about May, 90, 31111 again in J anuary, 100. The decision
011 the first occasion was that civil pr‹s›ceedings should go on first, 31111
meantime co-defendants and witnesses for the criminal proceedings
should be brought from the province. Peter's opinion is as follows z

The trial of Classicus is to be dated in September, 99, for

1. Both Marius Priscus 31111 Classicus governed provinces in the
same year.

2. Mommsen is obliged to assume that Pliny was praefectus aerarii
Saturni for four years, which is without example.
