LIFE OF PLINY xiii

positions open to consulars alone.¹ By way of preliminary
qualifications, the young aspirant to the cursus honorum
was required to fill one of the minor annual magistracies,
collectively called the Vigintiv'11·ate,2 and to serve at least a
nomina] term in the army as tribunus militum Zcetz'clcwz‘us,
ostensibly as <cide on the staff of some governor of a province
who commanded troops. Hence we often hear of the semen-
stris militia of a tribunus honores petiturus. Pliny was Χυίν
stlitibus iudicandisss in 81 or 82: His military tribuneship
was spent in Syria,4 where he was attached to the third
legion, ‘Gallica,’ and employed in clerical work connected
with the accounts of the armyf' At this time he must have
been twenty or a little older. After returning to Rome, he
obtained the quaestorship, the lowest senatorial
office. As the minimum age for this was twenty-
five,G he cannot have held it before 87. It seems most
probable that his term was from July 1, 89, to June 30, 90.
The fact that he was quaestor Caesaris indicates that he was
in high favor with the emperor Domitian at this time. The
lex αηηαῖῖε, which fixed the age at which each office might
be held, *also required an interval of at least a year between
the first and second, and between the second and third,
and of two years between the third and fourth offices. We
know that Pliny was praetor in 93.7 Meantime
he had been tribune of the stlebs‚⁸ probably from
Dec. 10, 91, to Dec. 9, 923 the year's interval between trib-
