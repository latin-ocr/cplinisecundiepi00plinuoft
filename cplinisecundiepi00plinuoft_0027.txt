it should. We are not troubled with misgivings, therefore,
in forming our estimate of him. As he tells his own story,
we may take him at his word. It is eminently fitting that
311011 3 111311, and the representative of such an age, should
appear before the world in a literary toilet thus 0310-
fully arranged. Letters whioh showed him en
de'slzccbz'lle, so to speak, or betrayed him at an
unguarded moment, when he forgot his pose, if he ever had
311011 3 11101110111, would be out of keeping. Pliny in a state
of nature would not be the real Pliny. He is least artificial
in the letters to Trajan, but he is not there at his best.
We appreeiate his abilities and his conscientious endeavors
as 311 administrator. But he is 0111 of his element at such
3 post 33 1110 governorship of a troublesome province. No
doubt he was proud to be trusted, but the position clearly
worried him, and in his heart he pined for the brilliant
society of Rome or the calm literary repose of his villas.
Pliny’s chief excellence as 3 writer 13 1113 eleccrmess, and
the ohief element of 1113 01131111 13 1113 modernncss, of thought
and expression. One evidence of this 13 the
singular felicity of Melinoth's translation in
‘Johnsonese' XVartou said of this version that
it bettered the original. While we might not be willing to
go so far 33 11131, we do feel that the extraordinary appro-
priateness 'of its eighteenth century English to the Latin of
the original letters stamps Pliny 33 111 many respects a
kindred spirit with the English authors of that time.
