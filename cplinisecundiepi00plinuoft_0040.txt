xxxvi IN'rnonto'rron. 11

b. Parenthesis : forty-one cases have been counted in the
first four books.

c. Asyndeton both of words and sentences is frequent.

Of sentences: in rapid narrative with much detail3 e.g.‚

1. 55 11. 10 (seven sentences); 11. 18. 2.

Of words: the three-membered asyndeton is developed
into a decided mannerisni, about one hundred instances
being connted in the letters and about thirty in the

Panegyric3 e.g.‚ VH 33 10

It often leads to an excessive niultiplication of words.
There are about forty cases of asyndeton of two members,
and about twenty with inore than three members.

(Ζ. Polysyndeton is comparatively infrequent3 about
thirty instances are counted.

e. Anaphora is very characteristic of such a rhetorical
style as Pliny's, and was in general strongly (leveloped in
the Silver Age. Pliny uses it even in simple passages of
quiet description, but in the Panegyric there are said to be
thirty-six cases in the first fifteen chapters, and seven in
the thirty-fourth chapter alone.

f. Hendiadys3 perhaps bnt one instance:

novitatem odoremque, 1x. 33. 9.

A sort of verbal hendiadys is illustrated in
cmnponvre (sc transissmw, V. 1. 7.
9. Aposiopesis:

Imm-[m Miseni eqo et mater , . ., v1. 16. 21.
