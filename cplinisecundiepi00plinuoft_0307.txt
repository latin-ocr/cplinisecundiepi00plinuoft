CHRONOLOGY 261

and infers that the business referred to in this letter would naturally
be dated back in 101, confirming his 111101011οο by the age 01 Suetonius
at that time, at the 11111001 Ep. I. 18, and at 011101· known dates.

Ep. 21. Upon the basis 01 this letter and what has preceded, he
fixes the death 01 Martial in 101.

Ep. 7. Silius Italicus died in his 75111 ι30111 111 101.

Boou IV.

Mommsen infers by a combination 01 Ep. 29. 2 with Epp. V. 4. 23
9 ; 13 ; VI. 5 and a diploma (Ηο11Ζο11, 6857), concerning the (late 01 1110
consulship 01 Licinius Nepos and Afranius Dexter, that this book was
issued 111 1110 beginning 01 105. He finds it consistent with this date
that Pliny no longer appears as praefectus aerarii (Ep. 12), but as a
consular (Epp. 8. »53 17. 3), aud receives the augurship (Ep. 8: ad
Trai. 13). All this suits 103 and 104. So does the fact that Trajan is
at Rome, for he returned from the first Dacian war in 102 and went to
the second in 105.

Boon V.

It is infel-red from allusions to Afranius Dexter, to Licinius Nepos,
that this book was issued the year after the 4th (100). The last five
books seem to have appeared 111 111010 rapid succession than the first
four. This may be inferred from the references 10 the trials 01 Bassus
and Varenus and to the proconsulate 01 Tiro. The rest 01 1110 0011-
tents 01 1110 book are consistent with its issue 111 100. Pliny again
appears as holding an office, and soon after this Cornutus becomes his
colleague by receiving the cura 01 the I'z'a Aemilia. Trajan is never
spoken 01 as at Rome3 this is the time 01 1110 second Dacian war
(105-106 or 107).

BOOK VI.

The monument 01 Verginius Rufus (Ep. 10) is not finished ten
years after his death. He died at the end of 07.

Pliny seems still in office (Ep. 4. 1). Trajan is at first absent in
Dacia, 111011 back 111 Rome after great deeds.

Other a‘llusions favor 106 or 107.

Booxzs VII., VIII„ IX„ treat less 01 public matters, and afford less
basis for chronological inference.

Boon VII.

The (late is inferred with some probability 110111 1110 references to
Cornutus, Varenus, Calestrius Tiro, and Pompeius Faleo.
