LIFE OF PLINY XV

101· some of the facts of Trajan's reign3 11111 with its 1111501116
adulation and long-winded rhetorio, it is very tiresome read-
ing--a great eontrast to the letters in point 01 interest.
After putting on the finishing touches, Pliny read it 101·
three suecessive days to an 6611161106 of his friends, who
professed to enjoy it. It was only 1611· 011 their part to say
50, for he was always infinitely obliging about listening to
the literary productions 01 other people. Exoept 101· this
solitary extant specimen we might 11616 entertained a higher
opinion 01 1115 oratory. Publio recitations, which
had begun 111 1116 111116 01 Augustus, had long
been a recognized institution. Aspirants 10
literary 161116 hired a publio room, filled it with an audienee
01 111611· friends, and there recited and deelaimed. The
0061111611011 01 thereal orator being taken from him by the
changed 1101111661 6011111110115 01 1116 age, the rhetorici-an had

equally labored and unnatural. Plin)v was appreciany
affected by the spirit 01 1115 time. At least he was an
enthusiastie and indefatigable listener as well as pei-former
