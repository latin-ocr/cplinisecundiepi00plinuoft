THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE LETTERS

The most important 6011111111111011 111 recent times 111 this subject is
Monnnsen's article in Hermes, III. pp. :Ji-1:39. Zur Lebensssesclzz'chce

Mommsen ininiinizes the signifieanee of the phrase in Ep. Ι. 1, non
serraco temporis ordine, 111111 6001101165 that upon the whole, though
not in every particular, the arrangement of the letters is ein-onsssogical,
and also that Pliny himself issued 1111 111116 books at successive dates,
The latter point may be inferred not merely froin the well known
practice of publishing liter-ary works in instalnients. but also from
Ep. IX. 19, slgsmficas lessisse te in quadam epistula mea, referring to
Ep. VI. 10, 111111 from Ep. VII. 28, addressed to the 5111116 person

versely that two certainly synchronous letters are never 1111· separated,
and that of a pair of letters the later one never coines first in the 601-
lection. A similar cln‘‹›11‹‘›logical order is traced in the references to
certain persons, eg.. M. Regulus 111111 (1016511105 Tiro, in the references
