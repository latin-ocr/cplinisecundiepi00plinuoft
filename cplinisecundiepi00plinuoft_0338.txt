ΑΝ attempt has been made in this volume to present in simple
and convenient form the assistance needed by young stu—
dents making their first acquaintance with Livy.

The editor‘s experience in the class-room has led him to anno-
tate the text copiously. On the other hand, that fulness of illus-
tration which apparently aims to supersede the function of the
teacher has been carefully avoided.

should like to say that &Vesteott's Livy is the most satisfactory text-book
that I know of. Other works may put on a greater show of learning;
but when one coines to every-day class-room use, the editing of this text
is found to be exceptionally satisfactory.

to nie an excellent hook. The notes are exceedingly fresh and scholarly;
they call attention to the right things in the right way. This edition is
superior to any similar edition with which 1 arn acquainted.
