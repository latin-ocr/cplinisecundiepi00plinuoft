Page 3. Letter 4. This letter appears to have been written after
‹January 1, 97, but before the death 01 Nerva. An account 01 (C. Li-
cinius) Voconius Romanus (cf. C.I.L. ΙΙ. 386 C. 3865a) is given in
Ep. II. 13. From this letter, and 110111 ad Trai. 4, it appears that he
was Pliny's tellow-student and comrade in arms, that he was an ad-
vocate, a flamen 01 Hither Spain (see note on Ep. 1Ι. 13. 4), that Pliny
obtained 101· him the ius trium liberm-mn from Nerva, and the latus
clavus from Trajan. Epp. I. 5; ΙΙΙ. 13 are addressed to Voconius
R01nanus3 Epp. II. 13 VI. 153 VI. 333 VIII. 83 IX. 73 Ix. 28
to Romanus. Demogeot (Plz'ne lc Jeune, Lem-es UIzotsies) says that
Romanus became a friend 01 Hadrian, who composed his epitaph:
Lascivus versu, mente pudicus erac.

1. M. Regulo: M. Aquilius Regulus rose to great wealth and
power under Nero by ⁴ delation.' Accused at the beginning 01 Vespa·
sian's reign, he was defended in the senate by his half-brother, the
eloquent L. Vipstanus Messalla. Tae. Hist. IV. 42. The charges
against him detailed by Tacitus tend to confirm our belief in the ‚iust-
ness 01 l'liny's opinion. Martial's effusive compliments to Regulus,
Epig. I. 12 ; 82 ; 111 ; IV. 16, count for nothing as testimonials to his
character. He stands almost alone as an object 01 open scorn and
detestation to I'liny, who is nearly always mild and charstable in his
judgments Pliny tells three seandalous stories about him, Ep. 11. 20 ;
describes his tasteless and hypocritical mourning at his son's death,
Ep. IV. 7 3 but after his death mourns his loss to the legal profession,
Ep. VI. 2. timidiorem humiliorem: Regulus feared punishment
for his crimes, after the death 01 his patron Domitian. But in dealing
with informers, as in many other respects, the government 01 Nerva
showed itself moderate, not to say feeble. Observe thc asyndeton;
this is a noticeable'feature 01 Pliny's style, but the same may be said
01 many authors who labor much atter striking effects.

3. tectiora: the free comparison 01 participia] adjectives, which
marks the Silver Age 01 Latin, is already noticeable in Livy.

5. Rustici Aruleni : L. Junius Arulenus Rusticus, a Stoic, pupil 01
Paetus Thrasea, was put to death in A.1). 93 for writing a panegyric
on Thrasea and Helvidius Priscus ; the book was publicly burned ; 01.
