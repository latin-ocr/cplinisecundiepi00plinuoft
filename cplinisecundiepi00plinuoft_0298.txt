Poppaea, ,1.1). 9). Hardy’s note gives ‘a convenient enumeration of
the privileges attached to thonius crium liberorum: (l) inlieritance of
legacies left to caelibes, which the latter were forbidden to take (ca-
duca); (2) preference ϊη petendis honoribus ,· (3) holding offices before
the legal age or without the legal interval; (4) preference in the
assignment of provinces ; (ᾧ) precedence before equals and colleagues;
(6) exemption from the dnties of tutor and indeo& (7) vmitigatio-n of
punishment in certain cases. Wise emperors granted the ius trium
lz'berorum sparingly, others more freely, to childless persons. The
grant was strictly persrmal, and did not benefit the heirs of the persons
concerned, nor was it in any way assignable.

10. Iuli Serviani: br‹.›ther-in-law of Hadrian, born about .x.n.47.
He held many i1np‹3›rtant official positions, and was one of the persons
mentioned in the will of Dasumius, already referred to3 see intro-
ductory note to Ep. 11. 6. For details, see Mommsen in Keil's Pliny.
At the time of this letter he was legate of Upper Germany. Pliny
addressed him in Epp. III. 17 and VI. 26.

Page 122. 1. rescripto: a rescriptum, sometimes called epis-
cala, was the technical name for the emperor's official reply to a
petition or to the inquiry of a magistrate asking for instructions or
advice.

2. summam voti : che heiyhc quydesz'res.

4. peculiarem: personal.

5. illo tristissimo saeculo: Domitian's reign.

6. duobus matrimoniis: this evidently means two marriages in
Domitian's reign. On the other hand, the letters about Calpurnia
seem to refer to a recent marriage, and are evidently to be dated well
on in 'l‘rajan's reign. Hence we infer that Calpurnia was the third
wife of l'liny ; see Introduction, page xviii.

8. patrem fieri: i.e., obtain the privileges of a father, become a
pater 111 the eye of the law. With the general sentiment of this sen-
tence, cf. Paneq. 26, Super omnia est tamen quod talis es, uc sub ιε’
liberos tollere libeat, aspediae.

Letter 103. This and the following letters were written from
Pliny's province, l'ontns and Bithynia3 see Introduction, page xviii.

11. socrui meae: Pompeia Celerina, mother of Pliny's second
wife, who had died in Aa). 97, as we may infer with strong probability
from Ep. Ix. 123. 4 and 12. Concerning Pompeia, see Epp. Ι. 4; III.
19. 83 VI. 10. 1 3 and notes.

12. in hanc provinciam: Bithynia.
