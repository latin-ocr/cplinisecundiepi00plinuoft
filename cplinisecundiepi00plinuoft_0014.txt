being a sagacious practica] 111101, had the good sense to encour-
age literature. Among all ,1113 subordinates none was more
trusted ‘than the Elder Pliny, who, in 77 A.D.‚ dedicated his
encyclopaedic ‘Natural History’ to Vespasian’s son Titus. ,

Doubtless the circumstance that Pliny was brought up by
this uncle rather than by his father had an influence upon
his after career. The uncleravas'afprodigyfflfeindust&

after 1113 testamentary adoption hythe uncle who had been in many
rvspccts a father to him, viz.⁷ C. Plinius Caecilius Secundus.
