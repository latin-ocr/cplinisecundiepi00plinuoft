LIFE OF PLINY xi

Young Pliny was so fortunate, inoreover, as to have 101· 1115
guardian¹ no less a man than Verginius Rufus, ι ,
whose iniportance is sufficiently indicated by the {afflatam
fact that he thrice refused the imperial purple.

With two such sponsors, it is not surprising that our
Pliny⁷s career in pohtics, at the bar, and in literature should
have begun early. His own ability, reinforced by hard
work, enabled him to grasp the success which rare social
and educational advantages put within his reach.

Great pains were taken with his bringing up. The condi-
tions of life among the Romans were then such
that almost the only way to practical success
was the career 01 the orator. Hence the education 01 a
gentleman was intended to train him to 110 an effective public
speaker, and ‘rhetoric' was synonymous with a liberal edu-
cation, general as well as special. Cato’s definition,--

Education

Orator est vir bonus dicendi peritus,2

well expressed the Roman ideal 01 an earlier age. The
inost complete exposition of the system 01 education in
vogue in the first century is found in the great work 01
Quintilian, the Institutio Oratorz'a. Quintilian was one 01
Pliny’s teacliei·s·'³—-tliat schoohnaster who be-
came consul, and whose career shows the esteem Teaehers
in which ‘rhetoric’ then stood. Another was the celebrated
Nicetes Sacerdos from Smyrna.4

It may have been at this period that Pliny⁷s life—long
friendship with Tacitus began. The only event in this early
part of his life 01 which we have detailed knowledge is the
memorable eruption 01 Vesuvius in 79 A.D., when
he was in 1115 eighteenth year. The story is
told in two letters to Tacitus.⁵ One 01 them
