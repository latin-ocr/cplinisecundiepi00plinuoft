262 APPENDIX. I

Boox VIII.

Ep. 23 cannot have been written before 108 or 109 11 Avitus is the
0116 mentioned in the testament 01 Dasumius.

130οΚ IX.

This 13 the poorest of all in dates. Possibly VIII. and IX. were

issued together3 all we can be sure 01 13 that they were not issued
before 108 or 109.

THE CORRESPONDENCE WlTH TRAJAN is independent 01 the chief
collection, which never had more than nine books

Epp. 1 and 2 come at the beginning 01 Trajan's reign.

Epp. 3-14 fall in the period before Pliny's (efflatio in Bithynia.

Epp. 15-121 all concern that Ζθᾳαιῐο, 30 far as they admit any 111-
ference as to date, place, and circumstance. Few 01 them can have
been written anywhere else.

Mommsen points out the important datum for this series. Pliny
mentions several times a Calpurnius Macer, a contemporary governor,
his nearest neighbor, a commander 01 legions. His province must
have been Lower Moesia (OLL. III. 777). Consideration 01 this and
other known facts leads Mommsen to date the leqatc'o from 111,
September, to 113, J anuary.

Mommsen's chronology of I'liny's 111613 followed in the biographical
portion 01 the Introduction.

H. F. Stobbe (Zur Ohronoloyie cler Briese des Plinius, Philologus,
XXX. 347-393) cmbodies the results 01 1113 own investigation, which
was independcnt 01 Mommsen's. The conclusions which he reaches
are somewhat different.

His discussion involves many of the same points as that 01 Peter
(see below), and his objections are mainly directed against Mommsen's
(lating 01 the proceedings against Classicus in 101. He thinks that
l'liny under-took the case in the autumn 01 99, while that of Priscus'
was still pending. If this was 30, it would not be necessary to assume,
as Mommsen does, that the 8th and 9th letters in the correspondence
with Trajan are out 01 place in the group 3-11, where all the others
are in strict order 01 time.

The principal distinctive feature 01 Stobbe's dissertation is an
elaborate consideration 01 the times and distances involved in the
correspondence supposed to have been carried on, by means of the
state couriers, between I’liny in Italy and Trajan 111 Pannonia, in
the summer 01 99.
