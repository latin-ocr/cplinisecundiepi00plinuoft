xxxviii INTRODUCTION. 11

ο. Fondness for pairs of nearly synonymous words :

(floria famaque ”. . . adsensio ct laus, ιν. 12. 6.
vetus ec αηίίυῑωη, 111. 6. 3.

Sometimes three such words are grouped:

orare, hortari, Iubere, v1. 20. 12.

p. Informal personification‚ by the use, in reference to
inanimate objects, of words which properly apply to living
bfflngs, is characteristic of the age.

The poetic coloring of the prose of the Silver Age was
not altogether the result of a conscious process. The lan-
guage of the great classic poets had become a part of univer-
sal expression, and was used, in great part7 unconsciously
by all writers.

q. There are rather too many proverbs, loci communes,
sententious phrases, which tend sometimes to produce the
impression of banality.

MARTIAL, x. 19.

N ec doctum satis et parum severum,
Sed non rusticulum nimis libellum
Facundo mea Plinio Thalia

I perfer: brevis et labor peractae
Altum vincere tramitem Suburae.

Illic Orphea protinus videbis

Udi vertice lubricum theatri
Mirantesque seras avemque regis,
Raptum <luae lr'hryga pertulit Tonanti3

——the rest of the epigram is quoted in Ep. 111. 21.
