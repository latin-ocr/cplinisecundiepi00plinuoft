10. theatris quoque ι’ ιο che meceres even. Interest in theatrical
exhibitions, and the consequent rivalry of amors, was so intense that
even before the close of the republic, actors sought to increase their
prestige by hired applause. The partisanship of the spectators often
led to riotous soenes. It was following the example of the theatre,
then, when the chaque was introduced into literary recitations and the
courts of law: Friedlander, Sz'tcengseschiclzte ΙΙ.6 p. 475; 111.⁵ 375.

11. ratio aetatis: consideration ofmy youth.

Letter 27. To Asinius Gallus is

ing is correct, and to Gallus, Ep.
