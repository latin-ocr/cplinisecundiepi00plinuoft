PREFACE

THERE are already before the publio so many editions
of Seleotions froni 'Pliny's Letters that I should not have
ventured, without the invitation of the general editors of
this series, to put forth another. Complianoe with their
request, however, has been av labor of love, and I trust
it may prove not altogether labor lost.

The publication of the whole of the Letters, with an
adequate ‹folnnientary in English, has for some time seenied
to nle a very desirable work, ——a work which Ι should like
in future to attempt, should it not meantime be undertaken
by one better qualified for the task. Such an edition
should be based upon a new reading of the manuscripts,
as is conspicuously shown by a oomparison of Keil's edition
with Professor Merrill’s collation of the Codex Riccardicmus
in the American ,Journal of Plciloloyy, for December, 1895.

My obligations, in the preparation of my Introduction
and Notes, have been chiefly to Mommsen's important
article on the Younger Pliny, in Hermes, IH.; to Kraut’s
and Lage1·g1·e11's dissertations on the langiiage and style of
Pliny3 and in a inore general sense to the various editors
oited in the list on page xli of the Introduction and the
Abbreviations on page 128. Indebtedness in detail I have
been oareful to acknowledge speoifioally.

The text is that of Keil, with a few (shanges.
