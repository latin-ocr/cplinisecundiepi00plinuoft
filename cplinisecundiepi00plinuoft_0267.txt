PAGE 85] NOTEs. LETTER 70 221

2. meatus animae: respiration. amplitudinem: full habit.
All this is an extremely elegant, way of saying that he snored
abominably-—a failing' of many excellent people.

4. diaeta: &nuculeum he was probably sleeping in a large airy
room, larger than the ordinary cubiculum. It may have been in a
separate wing of the house, or even a summer house beyond a court-
yard (area).

6. negaretur z would have been impossible (had he linger-ed longer
there). We should have expected the pluperfeet subjunctive. This
. is not merely a consecutive clause, but the apodosis of a conditional
sentence (contrary to fact). The imperfect tense gives greater vivid-
ness to the expression, on the principle of repraesentatio.

12. quamquam: to be connected with the adjectives, not with
the verb.

13. quod . . . elegit: compar-ison of danyers leil to α cimice of
this course, i.e.‚ to risk the consequences of exposure to the falling
stones. The antecedent of quod is hopelessly vague in point of gram-
mar, but the meaning is quite evident.

the repetition ratio racionem . . . timorem timor, combined with
chiasmus.

towels.

(the launchiny of cheir boat). vastum: wilzi, lzeswy.

21. adversum: i.e., on shore. linteum: α soil cloch from his
ship.

22. frigidam: sc. aquam.

24. sulpuris: this appears to be a better spelling than sulphuri&

26. clausoque stomacho . . . angustus . . . aestuans: clusina
the windpipe, which in his case usas subject το chronic umhwss,
marrow, aad often e'nflamed. There is an apparent, confusion between
the windpipe and the oesophagus, the latter being properly desig-
nated by stomacho. Bu‘t we must not be too severe upon Pliny's
anatomy and physiology. He made no pretensions to scientific
knowledge.

29. tertius: i.e.‚ he arrived on the eith, died on the 25th, was
found on the 26th August3 his ³ novissimus (ἤρε’ was the day before
he died.
