Pras 21] NOTEs. LETTER 18 153

by the adverb σεμνῶς, in Ep. II. 11. 17 . The conclusion of the Agr1001a
proves how eloquent Tacitus may have been on this occasion.

4. plenus annis: this is a finer phrase than Virgil's, Aen. VII. 53,
plenis annis ,· plenus in the best authors is usually constructed with the
genitive, but the ablative is frequent and is found even in Cicero.
‘Full of the honors he refused' is a fine example of oxymoron.

⁷. non solum publice, etc. z brachylogy 3 he evidently means
non solum publice [adiali-abar, sed eciam privatim] quantum admi-
rabar uentum dlliyebam.

8. regio: Transpadana. municipia finitima: near to Comum,
which was a free town, was the birthplace of Ve1·ginius‚—perhaps
Mediolanum.

10. tutor relictus: i.e., appointed by the will of Pliny's father; a
tutor was guardian of a boy (or girl) whose father was dead, till the
ward reached the age of fourteen (or twelve). A father had the right
to name by will a tutor for his surviving minor children; otherwise

the office devolved upon the nearest agnate kinsnian. adfectum:
this sense of the word is post-Augustali.

11. suffragio: with his support, influence. ad . . . honores:
οη che occasions osmy enter-[ny office.

13. officiis: functwnffi cf. page 6, line 13. sacerdotes: in

this case he means augurs, who formerly had been chosen by the
cooptatio of the college, but were now nominated by the emperor in
his quality of pontifex mam‘mus; hence nominabat in this sentence
means ⁴ reconnnended to the einperor.' Cf. Ep. IV. 8. 3, where Pliny
appears to have been nominated in this way by Frontinus, to whose
place he succeeded in the augural college, probably Α.11. 103.

16. quinqueviros: a comniission of five, appointed by Nerva, to
reorganize the public finances and retrench expenses after the extrava-
gance of Domitian's reign ; cf. Panesl. 62. 2. minuendis publicis
sumptibus: Prof. Platner (Am. J. Phil. ix. 217) says this construction
of the gerundive and a noun, equivalent to a clause of purpose, occurs
but four times in the letters of Pliny, whereas it is strikingly frequent
in Tacitus. B. 339. 7; A. ἃ G. 299.b; H. 544. 2. N. 33 Roby 1156.

19. huius aetatis: about thirty-five. per quem excusaretur:
this may mean to calce his place as a substitute, or only to present his
excuses. The latter view is perhaps the safer one.

20. tibi mandarem: I would θιὼ-ηδε che mis-sion to yon (to
Pliny); i.e., the mis-sion expressed in esrcztsarecm· above.

22. in sinu tuo: in your (sympaclm'zz'ny) bosom. si . . . fas
est, etc. ε cf. the so—called epitaph of Naevius, Aul. Gell. 124, Immor-
tales mortales, si soret saecsflvre, etc.
