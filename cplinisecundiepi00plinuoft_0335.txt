HE purpose of this book is to give such information regard-

Professor Edouard W‘dlfflffl, in the Arclziv fiir Latez'nisclze Lexikograplzie
und Grammatik. February, 1896. Aut' geringem Raume ist viel wis-
senswiirdiges z‘usammengedriingt, und zwar mit praktischem Geschicke2
zwei langere Listen geben die lateinischen worter von bestrittener Quan-
tit'at und Orthographie, wobei die Ansatze von Marx ott berichtigt sind.
. . . Die deutsche Wissenschast wird sich nur sreuen dass das amerikan-
ische Schulwesen ein so brauch'oares Hilssmittel gewonnen hat.

Hohe des heutigen XVissens.

Professor Harry Thurston Peck, Columbia Colle-ge, N.Y. .· Itis no exag-
geration to say that so compact, helpful, and practical a collection ot
indispensable information cannot be found elsewhere in any language
whatsoever. Even in Germany, the horne of Classical enchiridia, nothing
has yet appeared that is so satisfactory. Professor Bennett seems to
divine by instinct just what questions arise in the mind of the student,
and he here answers them in advance in a delightfully lucid and simple
fashion. . . . Everywhere the best authorities are cited; and it is certain
that to many reachers, as well as students, the mere perusa! of this little
manual will open up many new vistas, and will put them in touch with the
mostscholarly doctrine ot the day, ln fact the hook is one that no pro-
gressive instructor can afford to be without, as it summarizes an immense
amount of information that is of the utmost practical importance.
