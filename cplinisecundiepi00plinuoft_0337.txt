BEGINNING with the Song of the Arval Brothers, and
fragments from the Laws of the Kings and of the Twelve
Tables, these Selections illustrate Latin Literature down to the
time of Boethius. More than 130 authors are represented. and
no name of any reputation is wanting. No such condensed and
complete view of Latin literature can be found in any other
publication.

The text of this revised edition has everywhere been carefully
compared with that of a standard critical edition, and may be
considered as authoritative.
