the Latin of the Golden Age :

An eqo . . . dubitem, lv. 17. 2.

i. Nescz'o an sometimes amountsvto a mild negative3 eg,

111.1.1; 1v.2.1,
whieh is far from the strictly classica] usage. But it also
oeeurs in the sense os: a mild affirmative, or inelining in

that direction3 e.g.‚ Ι 15 3

j. Quamquam as an adverb oeeurs frequently with adjec-

with asyndeton of three or more members3 e.g.,

1. 9. 12 (3 members).

η’. 13. 3; vx. 2. 8.

e. The author is extremely fond of weram etiam (for sec]
