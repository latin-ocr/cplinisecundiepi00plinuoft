3. He is therefore obliged to consider‘Epp. ad Trai. 8 and 9 as out 01
the chronological order in which all the other letters 01 the group stand.

4. In Ep. VI. 29, where Pliny names the five great cases in which
he had been connsel, that of Classicus, with regard to its second main
discussion, is named before that of Marius Priscus.

The expression ante memoriam meam, in Ep. Π. 14. 3, and the
general tone 01 that letter mark Pliny as advanced in life.

Thus Peter goes through the books 111 order, finding a number 01
letters which seem to him inconsistent with the chronological arrange-
ment of Mommsen, his final conclusion being that we cannot accept
Monunsen’s scheme oi' arrangement— a purely negative conclusion.

Summing up, our verdict would be as follows ε The scheme arranged
by Mommsen commends itseli‘ in its main features. Certain points
may be considered as insufficiently established, but they do not invali-
date the conclusions as a whole. The argument is a constructive one,
in which the different parts, leading to a common object, have cumu-
lative force. Destructive argument is relatively easier. Conclusions
may be attacked, or even refuted, and nothing put in their place.
Some of the objections to Mommsen's positions are undoubtedly fanci-
ful or unsound, some may be admitted to be convincing in detail. In
one important particular the case against Mommsen's view is very
strongly supported; that is, in the matter 01 the date 01 the trial 01
Classicus and all that is involved therein. lVe may inodify our
acceptance 01 Monnnsen’s chronology to the extent 01 adopting the
conclusions 01 Stobbe and Peter in this respect, while believing it to
be substantially correct as a whole.

CRITICAL

Page 1, line 11. subiectus ec serviens lacus: serviens is imtrans-
latable. An estate which was bnrdened with an ‘easement' 101 the
benefit 01 another estate was called serviens. Thus the lake lying
below the villa, and lending itself. to the view, was a permanent
enhancement 01 its charm.

2, 8. exclude, MVD3 exauda ps·a; excute Fr Riccard. The meta-
phor 01 the first is embodicd in the note, that 01 the second (and third,
which appears merely a wrong transcription 01 the second) scenis to
be borrowcd from the forge or the sculptor's studio.
