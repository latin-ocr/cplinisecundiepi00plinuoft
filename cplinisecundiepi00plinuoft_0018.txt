uneship and praetorship had been reinitted by Domitian.1
He explains in Ep. Ι. 23 and in Panegyric 95 his reasons for
refraining from practice as an advocate during the year of
his tribuneship. He claiins credit also for modestia during
his praetorship. Certainly such conduct was prudent. That
it was not safe, in 93, to make one’s self conspicuous in
any way is evident froin Tacitus’s account of the‘death of
Agricola² in that year. Pliny was so discreet that he was,
as late as 94 or 95, appointed praefectus aerarii
commissioner mildam-is, an office which he held for three
of the military r . . . s
chest years. Revertheless, it appeared from papers
found in Doinitian's desk, after his murder,
that Pliny would, in all probability, soon have been added
to the list of the tyrant's victiins.3 Fortunately, however, he
was allowed to live on into the better times of Nerva and
Trajan. Yet his advanceinent, which had been steady and
rapid, partly perhaps owing to the support of
Cfommissioner Verginius Rufus? was arrested for the remainder
οΤῐὲξυὟ of Domitian⁷s reign. By Nerva he was made
praefectus aerarii Saturni, commissioner of the
Treasury, with his old friend Cornutus Tertullus for colleague.⁵
It was not till September, 100, that he attained the consul-
ship, which he held for that month and October,
again with Cornutus for his colleague. Upon
taking office, lie delivered in the senate the oration of thanks
for liis noinination by the emperor Trajan, which, revised
and enlarged, has come down to modern times
under the name of the Panegyric. This is a
